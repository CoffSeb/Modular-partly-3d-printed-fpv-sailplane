Here you can find documentation and files for modular 3d printed fpv sailplane. The sailplane has 2m wingspan and it is 1m long. Moast of the construction is 3d printed. The wing spars are constructed of 2 carbbonfiber piper each and the body is one thicker carbon fiber pipe. The wings are covered by radiocontrol modeling covering plastic. The body carbonfiber tube is designed so that the user can desighn and attach modular parts to it. This is not aerodynamicly good desighn but it is good for testing. When all the parts have found its plase in this modular system I intend to desighn v2 of the plane in more efficient way.
